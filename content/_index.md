# Audrey's Note to Self

I'm inspired by the concept of [learning in public](https://nesslabs.com/learning-in-public), which I heard of through Anne-Laure Le Cunff's _Tiny Experiments_. This site is meant to hold my notes (presented in a digestable way, hopefully) as I journey through my career as a software engineer.

This site was created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Hugo Bear Blog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) theme.
